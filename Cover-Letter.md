Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to be applying for the Software Engineer position. With a passion for coding and a proven track record of developing innovative software solutions, I am confident that my skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for this role. I am thrilled at the opportunity to show off my technical expertise and leadership skills as part of your team.

I will be graduating from the Computer Programmer-Analyst program at George Brown College in April 2025. Over the course of my studies, I acquired a variety of extra-curricular achievements and reached many milestones while maintaining consistent academic excellence. I achieved a national rank of 14 in Canada and placed in the top 17% globally in the IEEEXtreme 17.0 Competitive Programming competition. Additionally, I secured the 3rd position in Design Jam 2024 hosted by GBC in collaboration with Ontario Power Generation, showcasing my ability to deliver innovative solutions. I also had the opportunity to work as a tutor and teacher assistant, where I totalized more than 250 hours of tutoring, actively helping hundreds of students to succeed in their studies and projects. This experience allowed me to hone my communication and leadership skills while helping students grasp complex concepts in computer science and IT. I also took the role of project lead in many of the projects that I have collaborated on, following SCRUM methodologies, and ensuring that deliverables are tracked and met at each sprint making me accustomed to working in an Agile environment.

I am a diligent, teamwork-oriented developer with strong communication skills and a constant desire to learn, enabling me to interact with my colleagues and clients effectively and design innovative solutions to problems I encounter. I would be delighted to use all of my qualities and skills for the benefit of your company. You can find a list of projects that I have previously completed on my [Github](https://github.com/aadi219) and my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aadibadola).

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am looking forward to learning more details about the position. You can reach me through the following phone number 416-605-2907 or at aadibadola1@gmail.com.

Aadi Badola
